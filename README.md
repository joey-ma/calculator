# Calculator App

## About

This is an assessment for Unifai (https://www.unifai.us/).

Working buttons currently include: 
- all numbers 0-9
- decimal "."
- equal "="

Working functions currently include: 
- add "+"
- subtract "–" 
- multiply "×"
- divide "÷"
- clear ("AC")

## Dev Environment

I am using `parcel` for quick set up and the React framework (`react` & `react-dom`) for building the app.

# Notes

Stumbled upon `math.js` (https://mathjs.org/) and would be super cool to implement for future iterations or other projects.

Definitely more functions and features can be done to make this calculator even better!
